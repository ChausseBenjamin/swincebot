/*
 * This package isn't the actual swincebot server.
 * To avoid importing packages which aren't needed at runtime,
 * some auto-generation functionnalities is offloaded to here so
 * it can be done with access to the rest of the code-base but
 * without bloating the final binary. For example,
 * generating bash+zsh auto-completion scripts isn't needed in
 * the final binary if those script are generated before hand.
 * Same gose for manpages. This file is meant to be run automatically
 * to easily package new releases.
